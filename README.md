Working out Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) with Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLV, "the present value of future cash flow attributed to a customer's tenure with a company", can be determined by variety of approaches.  Based on a simple [equation](http://www.r-bloggers.com/calculating-customer-lifetime-value-with-recency-frequency-and-monetary-rfm/), one can calculate the cumulative profit (value) from a customer based on assumptions such as retention rate and historical profit margin from customers.  However, a customer's retention can be influenced by factors such as demographics (age, geography, education background), behavior (Recency, Purchase Frequency, Monetary Contribution), competitions, peer influences, etc..  As a result, a dynamic approach should be taken to account for such variations.

In this repo, I calculated CLV by predicting the retention rate (r) of customers' future purchasing cycle using Logistic Regression based on his/her Recency of purchase, purchase Frequency, and Monetary contribution from past purchases.

### RFM
By definition, RFM represents:

 - R(ecency): how recently did a customer make a purchase?
 - F(rquency): how often does the customer make purchases?
 - M(onetary Value): how much do they purchase each time on average?

### Data
The CDNow data set ([DOWNLOAD](http://brucehardie.com/datasets/)) has 69,659 transaction records by 23,570 different customers. The purchase records between Jan 1997 and June 1998 are also captured.

This project was mainly inspired by the work done by Jack Han at [Data Apple](http://www.dataapple.net/?p=84).  However, new libraries/functions are used to update data transformation and visualization of data such as dplyr and ggviz.
